## Recommendations

As a recommendation to Acorns, there are some products and services I would suggest they offer to current and future users that I believe is working. 
1. Spare change from your bank account is helping invest in stocks that over time turns in profit and helps increase your worth and value. 
2. A person who does not know how to invest or know of any stocks to invest in, this is a sure way to get your feet wet and learn how to invest. By allowing Acorns to invest for you, the small amount of money you are investing could make a profit or become a lost to the market. 
3. An alternative way of banking. By looking at ways to increase your savings, going with a Robo-advisor will make the banking experience a little different, but makes it a safe way to save. 
No company is a sure thing. There are some negatives about this company and services. 
1. There are service fees when using the application. Those fees can range from $1 to upwards over $9, depending on the tier service you choose. 
2. Your investment folder will not make you wealthy overnight or even a year. Remember, y0u are investing small change and more than likely, investing in stocks that do not produce high profit margins in the stock market.
3. Acorns charges $1 per month for accounts with less than $1 million. Over that amount and you can tack on another0.25% per year. 
4. If there any technical or banking issues, support is only offered via email. It would make it hard to get a resolution immediately.
Acorns target audience are those who don’t want to be a part of the investment selection process. This service is great for people like me who have no Idea what it would take to invest in stock and try to make my money work for me. The average human isn’t wealthy. The concept of what the company offers will help individuals build wealth with a few dollars a month. Technologies such as a phone, laptop or tablet helps a person take their money wherever they go. Being able to view your account(s) from a device, helps a person to make decisions quicker than either visit or calling your bank to find out your current balance. The day of the check ledger is gone. I would give this company a try and see what it can do for me. By learning how to invest, Acorns could be the beginning of helping many turn small change into large amounts of money.
